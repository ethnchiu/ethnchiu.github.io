## Learning Typescript
- Reminds me of Python
- Good programming language since it encourages static typing which is important for type safety
    - Despite the fact that it doesn't necessarily translate into any changes in the transpiled JS code




## Athleticism

In high school I was a member of the varsity tennis team. As a player on the team, I was expected to consistently show up to practices, despite the fact that they took place late in the afternoon and miles away from my home. Although I would have preferred hanging out with my friends or getting home right after class and finishing my schoolwork early, I was determined to attend every practice to improve my tennis skills. I believe this dedication paid off, not only because I subsequently had reasonably successful seasons, but also (and primarily) because I was able to develop a lifelong skill that can be used to stay fit, have fun, and even function as a networking medium.

Similarly, software engineering is also a *skill*; one that requires consistent practice and significant dedication to become proficient in. A powerful tool for improving competency in software engineering is, as I'm learning in my current University of Hawaii at Manoa ICS course ([ICS 314](https://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f25/index.html)), a pedagogical technique called [athletic software engineering](https://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/2016/16-01/16-01.pdf) (ASE). The premise of ASE is that . Its implementation in this course takes the form of workouts of the day (WODs), which are timed, pass-or-fail coding problems that assess students' ability to complete tasks using the skills learned from the course. Each WOD is accompanied by a video of the instructor solving the same problem, with the ultimate goal of encouraging the student to repeatedly practice completing the task and improving their time to be on-par with the instructor's.
