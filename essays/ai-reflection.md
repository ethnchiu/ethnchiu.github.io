## I. Introduction

AI has become a ubiquitous tool when it comes to software engineering (and learning as a whole). People of all ages use their favorite LLMs to draft up emails, clarify homework questions, and explain difficult concepts. In my ICS 314 (software engineering) class, we were allowed to—even encouraged to—use AI to aid us in coding. Personally, when I used AI I made use of ChatGPT and Gemini.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Although I occasionally turned to LLMs to help clarify some coding questions, I avoided using AI to do any real coding for me. The following are my reflections on my personal experiences with AI technologies in ICS 314:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I did not use AI for experience WODs since I wanted to learn the skills myself and could reference the video guide if I got stuck.

2. In-class Practice WODs

I did not use AI for in-class practice WODs since I wanted to learn the skills myself and these allowed me to put what I learned in the experience WODs into practice.

3. In-class WODs

I did not use AI for in-class WODs since I wanted these to actually test my own ability to code.

4. Essays

I did not use AI for essays since I wanted to improve my writing skills.

5. Final project

I mostly did not use AI for the final project. Occasionally I would ask ChatGPT to clarify difficult topics when I couldn't find enough information on sites like Stack Overflow.

6. Learning a concept / tutorial

I occasionally used ChatGPT to help me rapidly learn a new concept since it could rapidly provide in-context code blocks.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

I did not use AI for answering in-class or online questions since I could find everything needed to answer the questions online.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question

I did not use AI for answering/asking smart questions since I wanted to practice formulating and answering these myself.

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I occasionally used ChatGPT to help provide coding examples of using a method or library to quickly learn how to implement it.

10. Explaining code

I did not use AI to explain code since I wanted to practice my ability to understand others' code.

11. Writing code

I did not use AI to write code since I wanted to practice my software engineering skills.

12. Documenting code

I did not use AI to document code since I wanted to practice my documentation skills.

13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code here” or “Fix the ESLint errors in here”

I did not use AI for quality assurance since any errors could be debugged by reading the console or running the linting program.
