## I. Introduction

AI has become a ubiquitous tool when it comes to software engineering (and learning as a whole). People of all ages use their favorite LLMs to draft up emails, clarify homework questions, and explain difficult concepts. In my ICS 314 (software engineering) class, we were allowed to—even encouraged to—use AI to aid us in coding. Personally, when I used AI I made use of ChatGPT and Gemini.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

Although I occasionally turned to LLMs to help clarify some coding questions, I avoided using AI to do any real coding for me. The following are my reflections on my personal experiences with AI technologies in ICS 314:

1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I did not use AI for experience WODs since I wanted to learn the skills myself and could reference the video guide if I got stuck.

2. In-class Practice WODs

I did not use AI for in-class practice WODs since I wanted to learn the skills myself and these allowed me to put what I learned in the experience WODs into practice.

3. In-class WODs

I did not use AI for in-class WODs since I wanted these to actually test my own ability to code.

4. Essays

I did not use AI for essays since I wanted to improve my writing skills.

5. Final project

I mostly did not use AI for the final project. Occasionally I would ask ChatGPT to clarify difficult topics when I couldn't find enough information on sites like Stack Overflow.

6. Learning a concept / tutorial

I occasionally used ChatGPT to help me rapidly learn a new concept since it could rapidly provide in-context code blocks.

7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

I did not use AI for answering in-class or online questions since I could find everything needed to answer the questions online.

8. Asking or answering a smart-question

I did not use AI for answering/asking smart questions since I wanted to practice formulating and answering these myself.

9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I occasionally used ChatGPT to help provide coding examples of using a method or library to quickly learn how to implement it.

10. Explaining code

I did not use AI to explain code since I wanted to practice my ability to understand others' code.

11. Writing code

I did not use AI to write code since I wanted to practice my software engineering skills.

12. Documenting code

I did not use AI to document code since I wanted to practice my documentation skills.

13. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code here” or “Fix the ESLint errors in here”

I did not use AI for quality assurance since any errors could be debugged by reading the console or running the linting program.

14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

I believe that AI can be a useful tool for quickly creating prototypes or fixing errors, but it can also sabotage real learning if used excessively and without care. I personally think that if you can't implement something yourself, you should carefully consider whether you should use AI to implement it for you, or whether you should read documentation and search the internet to understand it. In other words, AI needs to be used in moderation to balance with real learning. 

If I blindly used AI throughout ICS 314, I think I would have weaker comprehension, less skill development, and worse problem-solving abilities. In this way, AI technologies pose a challenge to software engineering education. On the other hand, by carefully selecting when to resort to AI, I'm able to more clearly understand the topic and improve the quality and speed of my overall learning.

## IV. Practical Applications

Personally, I have utilized AI in an extracurricular project. In that project, I prompted AI to help me write unit tests for some Python code. In another project, I made use of AI to help me with developing an application when I had trouble learning unfamiliar concepts.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

A challenge with AI in ICS 314 is that popular LLMs that just want to keep you chatting are too accessible, and there isn't a suitable alternative to choose from. In ECE 345, we're provided an LLM that is only able to answer in the context of what we've learned in the class so far. It's tailored to help guide you rather than blatantly providing you with answers, striking a balance between accessibility and education. ICS 314 (and software engineering courses in general) can potentially integrate a similar LLM to give students an alternative to the popular LLMs.

## VI. Comparative Analysis

In the context of software engineering, traditional teaching methods employ resources such as textbooks, documentation, and existing code to teach students. Although this might lead to lower engagement (relative to AI-enhanced approaches), it is what has worked for decades across many fields for knowledge retention and gaining practical skills. AI-enhanced teaching methods make use of AI in the form of generative LLMs to supplement or maybe even replace the former resources. Although the fast-paced, dopamine-inducing replies of the LLMs may improve engagement, oftentimes it can lead to lesser knowledge retention and weaker practical skills.

## VII. Future Considerations

However, given that the use of AI has become so prevalent in society and software engineering, I believe that it's unavoidable that it has to play a bigger role in software engineering education. AI should be used not as a replacement for traditional teaching methods, but rather as a useful complement. For example, LLMs can be developed that act like teaching assistants when professors are busy, providing useful guidance and advice and not spoiling the learning process by immediately revealing the answer.

## VIII. Conclusion

Although AI at the current scale is a very new phenomenon, it has become an integral part of society as a whole, as well as software engineering. Although I personally try to avoid relying heavily on AI, I believe the future of education requires better integration and improvement of LLMs for this purpose.
